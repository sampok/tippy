# Pre-work - *Tippy*

**Tippy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Sampo Karjalainen**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Custom font
* [X] UI animations: Tip and total fade in/out
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Custom layout
- [X] Hide status bar

## Notes

- Using a mock to place UI elements in correct positions in Interface Builder is a bit clumsy. Need to create a temporary Image View. Can't zoom in.
